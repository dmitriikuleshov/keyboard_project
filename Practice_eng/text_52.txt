Virginia O'Hanlon Douglas was the eight-year-old girl who, in 1897, asked the staff of The New York Sun whether Santa Claus existed. In the now-famous editorial, Francis Church assured Virginia that yes, indeed, "there is a Santa Claus." The first dictionary of American English was published on April 14th, 1828, by - who else? - Noah Webster. No automobile made after 1924 should be designated as antique.
