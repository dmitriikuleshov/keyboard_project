Houses were first numbered in Paris in 1463. In Britain, numbering did not appear until 1708, on a street in London's Whitechapel area. In ancient Greece, courtesans wore sandals with nails studded into the sole so that their footprints would leave the message "Follow me". In 1937 the emergency 999 telephone service was established in London. More than 13,000 genuine calls were made in the first month.
