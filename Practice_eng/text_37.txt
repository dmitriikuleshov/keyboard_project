The first telephone exchange opened on January 28, 1878, in New Haven, Connecticut. In the late 30's, a man named Abe Pickens of Cleveland, Ohio, attempted to promote world peace by placing personal calls to various country leaders. He managed to contact Mussolini, Hirohito, Franco and Hitler (Hitler, who didn't understand English, transferred him to an aide). He spent $10,000 to "give peace a chance."
