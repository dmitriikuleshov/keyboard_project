if i do i like words
i walked forward
we do look alike
all is well
sure i do
so far all was well
i awoke
a ladder was raised
words are useless
joe asked
i adore flowers
i feared worse
well; well; dear
looks like a dress
four dollars a week
i was afraid
so i did; dear
so far all is well
off for a week
we were afraid
i was asked
also i was awkward
we are all as usual
well; we will see
