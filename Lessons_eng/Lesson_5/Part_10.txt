i know
so did i once
our consciences were clear now
now all is safe and sound
i will and can do so
no one could lie down
confidence increased
an occasion was soon found
no one else was injured
we looked around
i was all alone
well i know
one window and four doors
i dislike crowds and noise
no one will see us
red cloud
i was a winner
of course
a silence fell
kick once
we faced a cold wind
duck under sofa
and i wondered
essence underlies influence
decrease in loudness of sound
reason is confounded
