And all your effort was to make me afraid of life. It is justice you owe me.
It was a weary walk. I do not want your money. I am afraid it is necessary.

To marry, or not to marry. Truly yours. I went to rest. You now know my family.
You never can tell. You just take it easy and wait. Not for myself.
