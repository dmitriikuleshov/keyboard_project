duress direful fussier ruff jarful
fissured rudder lured rudderless duskier
reassures suffers erasure fulfiller fur
refuelled fissures laurels rudders surer
kauri rural leisure fissure furred
fluidiser ruddier ruse assure reuses
radius refusals auras residual sufferer
refuse furriers ruffed fuller issuer
